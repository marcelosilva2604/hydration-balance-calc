# Hydration Balance Calculation Project

This project is a **Python** application designed to calculate and monitor the hydration balance of patients. It uses the **Tkinter** library to create a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows the input of patient data and measurements and clearly displays the hydration balance results.

## Features

- **Graphical User Interface**: Simple and intuitive, built with Tkinter.
- **Patient Data Entry**: Allows input of patient’s name, bed number, and weight.
- **Measurement Entry**: Records vital signs such as temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, and more.
- **Hydration Balance Calculation**: The program calculates fluid intake and losses and provides the final hydration balance.
- **Dynamic Results**: Displays a complete report of the hydration balance calculations.
- **Copy Results**: The ability to copy results for further use.
- **New Patient**: Functionality to clear all fields and begin entering a new patient’s data.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3**: Ensure that Python 3 is installed on your system.
- **Tkinter**: The Tkinter library is included with many Python distributions. If not installed, you can install it with the following command:

  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install python3-tk
