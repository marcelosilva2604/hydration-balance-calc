## Project Description
This project is a Python-based application designed to assist healthcare professionals in calculating and monitoring the hydration balance of patients, particularly in neonatal and pediatric intensive care settings.

The application uses Tkinter to create a graphical user interface (GUI), allowing users to input patient data and measurements, and automatically calculates the patient's hydration balance. The balance is based on fluid intake and losses, and the results are displayed in an intuitive report format.

### Key Features:
- Input patient details like name, bed number, and weight.
- Record vital signs and calculate fluid intake and losses.
- Dynamic result display and ability to copy results.
- New patient reset functionality for continuous use.
